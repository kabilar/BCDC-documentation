## BCDC Data Curation Help

This is the page for help documents and resources for BICCN data submitters. Use the following links to navigate to important documents and tools that are needed for submitting data and metadata to the BICCN.


### Overall Process

Our goals for Data Curation at the BCDC are:

* Building the [BICCN Data Catalog](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/data?fprogram.title=BRAIN%20Initiative%20Cell%20Census%20Network) as a key point of access and valuable resource for users
* Coordinating with the data archives to maintain an updated inventory of all BICCN specimens for grant reporting purposes

The BICCN Data Catalog is organized into **Projects** that have one or many associated **Data Collections**. Data Collections
consist of a collection of **Specimens** that have data assets at the archives. 

#### Project and Data Collection Metadata

- General grant and dataset level metadata, E.g. Text descriptions of datasets, Protocols, Licensing, Contributors, Institutions, Funding
- This is recorded when registering new projects/data collections, so that BCDC can plan for what data we will have coming in
- Project and Data Collection metadata is displayed on the Project landing pages in the BCDC Data Catalog [SCREENSHOT to Data Catalog page]

#### Specimen and File Metadata 

- This is individual sample and file level metadata, E.g. Species, Genotype, Age, Specimen Type, File Type 
- These metadata are displayed on Specimen pages in the BCDC Catalog, and are also used for searching/filtering the data
- Specimen metadata is used to maintain a census of all data collected by BICCN, for alignment with the archives and reporting research output to NIH
- A manifest of file metadata indexed by specimen is created by the archives and shared with BCDC, with file metadata including file type, unique ID, URI

### Project and Data Collection Registration

Projects and their associated data collections are registered at BCDC at the start of the grant/project. **New data
collections must be registered with BCDC before submitting data to the relevant archives.** 
For this, you will need to fill out a project/data collection template and submit this to the BCDC Data Curation team. Contact 
the Data Curation team to guide you through the process of registering your project and associated data collections.

Changes to Project metadata such as adding new Contributors, editing project or data collection descriptions, or editing contact information, 
can be made online through the BCDC Project Data Curation tool - for a personalized login and link to the tool,
contact the BCDC Data Curation team.

### Specimen Registration and Submission Receipts

Specimen metadata is collected on a quarterly basis to align with reporting requirements for the NIH. Specimen metadata is reported to BCDC at the 
time when data is deposited at the archives. **Specimen metadata includes the name of the data collection that the specimens are added to, so projects
and data collections must be registered before a specimen inventory can be created and data submitted to archives.** Please contact the BCDC
Data Curation team when submitting data for the first time for help in completing the inventory template.

Specimen metadata inventories are submitted through our online portal, which is currently under active development. Please contact BCDC to set up an account 
for the ingest portal. Once metadata has been submitted, uploads can be reviewed and data receipts generated for NIH reporting purposes in the ingest
portal itself.

* BCDC Specimen Ingest Portal: [https://bcdc.ingest.brain.allentech.org/](https://bcdc.ingest.brain.allentech.org/)


### File Manifests

File manifests for newly added specimens are created by the archives when data is submitted, and shared by the archives with the BCDC Data Curation team.
The archives collect metadata about files when data is ingested, and BCDC receives that information from the archives, along with critical metadata
about data publication such as archive-assigned file UIDs and URIs. For more information on file metadata collection, contact the archives.


### Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies

As part of our commitment to following community standards in curating BICCN data, BCDC uses controlled vocabularies and ontologies for metadata.
The list of controlled terms for selected fields are included on both the Project and Specimen metadata templates, and lists of controlled terms including
definitions are maintained on a separate site here:
